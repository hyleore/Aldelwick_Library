# Aldelwick Library
## About this project
This project was made as the assessment for a course on 2D Game Development given by Isaac Pante (Faculty of Arts, University of Lausanne). The aim was to make an academic topic accessible and understandable through a game.

The idea behind Aldelwick Library was to create **a puzzle-type game that would replicate the experience of transcribing manuscripts**.
After a tutorial, the player is expected to type down the transcription of a simple manuscript page.
The game takes place in a fantasy-like world in order to take inspiration from medieval manuscripts while simplifying them.

## Sources and Credits
### Script
Two manuscripts were used as inspirations for the script (handwriting) used in the game:
- London, British Library, Harley 535, a fifteenth-century manuscript.
- National Library of Scotland, Advocates MS 19.2.1 or The Auchinleck Manuscript, a fourteenth-century London manuscript, available online [here](https://auchinleck.nls.uk/contents.html)
- *The Cambridge History of The Book in Britain, Volume 2, 1100-1400* (Nigel Morgan and Rodney M. Thompson, eds., Cambridge UP, 2008) was also helpful in creating the script for the game.
